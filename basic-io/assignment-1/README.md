# KRS
We were asked to make a program that takes the course we're taking and the SKS weight as input and print the pretty ouput on the screen, like a KRS. HOWEVER, no loops, no arrays, no if-else. At this point, we all know whats inside the code. BUT, this code has been approved by my lecturer so i think no improvement can be made. This monstrosity includes:

- Sh*t ton of variables
- `cout` chains longer than 10
- Copy-pasted code
- Written in Dev C++ :sob:

If you want to fix it or rewrite it with more features like arrays, loops, and all of the fancy stuff, please make a new file on the ![fix directory](fix/) with this format
- `<number>-death.cpp`
- e.g `001-death.cpp`
