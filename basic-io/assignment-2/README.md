Now this is a take home assignment, nothing too hard, just the same thing with ![KRS assignment](../assignment-1) but with 3 items and some math, nothing too hard. Like usual, no loops, no arrays, no if-else, so more pain. This one is unique however, im using tabs (`\t`) to format my output. It looks good, but is an absolute nighmare to read the actual code. This code includes:

- Copy-pasted code
- Lots of `cout`'s. No chains however
- Some math

If you want to fix it properly, you can make a new file at the ![fix directory](fix/) with the following format:
- `<number>-assignment_shop.cpp`
- e.g `001-assignment_shop.cpp`
